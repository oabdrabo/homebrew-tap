  caveats <<~CAV
    DisplayDeck is ad-hoc signed and built on private APIs.
      - Display / HiDPI / brightness / warmth work out of the box.
      - Window transparency, blur, keep-on-top and the picture-in-picture
        pin need SIP disabled + the -arm64e_preview_abi boot-arg.
      - Picture-in-Picture also needs Accessibility permission.
    On first launch it asks once for an admin password to install its
    scripting addition into Dock.
